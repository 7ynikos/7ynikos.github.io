>"A WEEK WITHOUT WIFI?"

honestly, think about it `connectivity` is the reason we are ever so distracted. constantly connected to people, not that it's bad but— to entertainment. entertainment is at our fingertips, several ways of stimulus. which leads to overstimulation, and no mindset is going to help us anymore, none of us have the will power for it. 
I'm honestly unsure about myself into this experiment too.

i average around 5 hours screentime per day, around which 2-3 hours are non-productive.
that's 2-3 hours of my day wasted. I could've been productive at this time. and this guilt consumes me over.

so I've decided to use myself as a test subject for this experiment, going in from now, after this post, you won't see me for a week. you may wonder how I'll be going through the day.

|WAKEUP|
|------|
|2 STUDY SESSIONS|
|------|
|LEISURE READING (INSTEAD OF SCROLLING)|
|------|
|SCHOOL(7 HOURS)|
|------|
|7 STUDY SESSIONS(W)|
|------|

I'll be follow a similar pattern for weekends too.
I log my study times using YPT, but I won't do it because my phone has cellular data so I'll probably start using it, I need to cut everything off. I'll use a kitchen timer and a book to log my study times. I have downloaded few lectures just in case. I'm going all in. 
I've also downloaded few videos from which I can gain something, I will be making notes of them, and will be posting them.

also I've coded a time-tracking cli app so i might use that too since I can plug in how many sessions, and at the end of the day a screenshot is enough to show the complete days study sessions. but I'm not sure let's see, I might record YPT from a dummy phone with no cellular data, but we'll see.
