Recently I've been studying late into the night, sometimes till 2AM-3AM usually I sleep after coming back from school at like 3.20 so I sleep from 4-5, if time permits but this is what I used to do. Now I don't sleep i rush home, try to be at home by 3.10, complete everything by 3.30 and start my study sessions. 

my study sessions follow `50/10`time blocks, i.e I study for 50 minutes and take a break for 10 minutes or sometimes it's `60/10`, but yeah how do I study from 3.30 pm to 2.00 am, i meanu ofcourse there's longer breaks in between (for like only dinner lol) but yes how do I stay up you may ask, well I found this trend online where people drink coffee and it takes around `20 mins`for the caffeine to kick in so as soon as they drink coffee they fall asleep (i have no idea how that's possible it atleast takes me 10 mins to fall asleep because my brain is overstimulated xD) but yeah so I've been doing this or just completely raw dogging it.


and honestly,
my body can function with 4-6h of sleep, so usually when I do sleep by 10-11 I wake up at 3-4 and have two study sessions in the morning and around 6-7 study sessions in the evening after school.

it's a different story during weekends, i average around 12 study sessions a day.
